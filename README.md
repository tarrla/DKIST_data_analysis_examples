An example set of routines giving a few examples of how to start exploring 
data collected by the ViSP instrument at DKIST.

I also show some simple comparisons with SDO/HMI and VBI data, as well as some 
additional polarization calibration that could be considered if you want to 
perform scientific analysis, as opposed to just making pretty pictures.

This notebook is mostly about making pretty pictures.
